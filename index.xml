      <description>This is actually why (or saying the trigger) I create a website and begin blogging.
Recently I was preparing for changing job. Inevitably I have to prepare for the coding interviews. It was funny that the recruiters from all of the companies I interviewed with suggests online coding websites to get prepared, and first ones of every list is leetcode.com.
During these 3 months in preparing, I was discussing with my teammates/friends about what we want to see from interviews as interviewers.</description>

      <description>This is technically first post in this blog. I thought it&amp;rsquo;s worth to write down the process of creating this static website.
I choose to use English as the language in this blog, which might be helpful in future. Or I may switch to Chinese anyway.
Steps  Searched a little bit in zhihu.com and found this post about create website using huge quick start with hugo: https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/ and hosting on github: https://gohugo.</description>

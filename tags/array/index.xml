      <description>Question Leetcode 560: Subarray Sum Equals K
Given an array of integers and an integer k, you need to find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to k.
Note:  The length of the array is in range [1, 20,000]. The range of numbers in the array is [-1000, 1000] and the range of the integer k is [-1e7, 1e7].  Examples Example 1:
Input:nums = [1,1,1], k = 2 Output: 2  Solution Method 1 (TLE) 我一开始想到的解法是使用一个存了dict的array，记录下每个位置上出现的所有可能的sum的数量。这样进行到每一位的时候只需要看一下他前面那个位置的dict，就能得到包含当前位置数字所有可能出现的sum。</description>

      <description>Question Leetcode 807: Max Increase to Keep City Skyline
In a 2 dimensional array grid, each value grid[i][j] represents the height of a building located there. We are allowed to increase the height of any number of buildings, by any amount (the amounts can be different for different buildings). Height 0 is considered to be a building as well.
At the end, the &amp;ldquo;skyline&amp;rdquo; when viewed from all four directions of the grid, i.</description>

      <description>This is a question from leetcode.com.
Problem Question You are given a series of video clips from a sporting event that lasted T seconds. These video clips can be overlapping with each other and have varied lengths.
Each video clip clips[i] is an interval: it starts at time clips[i][0] and ends at time clips[i][1]. We can cut these clips into segments freely: for example, a clip [0, 7] can be cut into segments [0, 1] + [1, 3] + [3, 7].</description>
